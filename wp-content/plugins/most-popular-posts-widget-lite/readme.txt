== Description ==

Most Popular Posts is a widget that is able to display a list of the most popular posts of your site (ranked by number of visits or number of comments). With it you can show your visitors which content are most popular, and built-in styles give you the ability to customize its appearance to your page. Widget / plugin is ideal for small news sites and blogs. This is an excellent way to increase click-through rate and reduce the bounce rate of page.

If you are worried about your server's resources, I can assure you that the widget extremely tight cares about this issue. Its simple design makes you sure that the database on your server will not be filled with unnecessary data.

= You can customize: =
* The title of the widget
* Rank posts popularity by number of comments or visits
* The number of the displayed items (to choose from 1 to 10)
* Showing only those posts that were visited by example. Last 30 days (to choose from range from 1 to 30 days)
* Disable or enable the display of the number of visits
* Exclude from displaying specific pages and whole categories (by their ID)
* Change translation
* Change the appearance of the widget (you can choose from 6 ready styles or create your own (file custom.css), along with subsequent updates of the number of available styles will increase)
* Clean the widget data from SQL database (if you decide that take too much)
* Cache refresh time

In addition, the widget has a built-in filtering visits robots, so that the collected data do not include web bots. Widget styles perfectly cope with the parties and look great on mobile devices. Widget also support shortcode [most-popular-posts].

Widget is very simple to install and use, which should not be a straightforward problem to anyone.

Widget could be not compatible with catching plugins, like W3 Total Cache etc.
